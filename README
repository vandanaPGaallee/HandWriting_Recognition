This repository consists of Jupyter notebook and python files which is an implementation to find the similarity between handwritten samples of the known and the questioned
writer by using predictive models like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Neural Networks. The features are obtained from two different sources:
1. Human Observed features: Features entered by human document examiners manually
2. GSC features: Features extracted using Gradient Structural Concavity (GSC) algorithm.
The project applies machine learning to solve the handwriting comparison task in forensics and the target values are scalars that can take two values {1:same writer, 0:different writers}.
The notebook consists of the steps to preprocess, feature selection, training and evaluation for the given task.
